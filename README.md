# CS360: Module Eight Journal
<br>
<br><b>Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?</b>
<br> The app that I developed was an inventory management app. The requirements included a login screen that accepts credentials in the system, a registration page for users to join the system, an place to add or delete or update items, a method to request SMS permission to send users notifications when their inventory is low, and the ability to see a list of all items in the inventory. When it comes to goals, the most important one was to create a functional app that meets all of the requirements expected. The user needs that this app was designed to address were the needs that come with keeping track of multiple items, regardless of whether that is being tracked in a professional or personal capacity.
<br>
<br><b>What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?</b>
<br> Perhaps the most important screen is the screen dedicated to adding, updating, and deleting items. The registration and login screens are also necessary because they allow the users to have a personalized experience within the app where their information will be protected. When I designed the UI, I kept the users in mind by remembering how it feels as an app users to deal with complicated, counter-intuitive apps. My designs were successful in terms of my vision for them because they embodied the lesson I learned about not being hung up on extra features, and how I learned to start with the basics first since these are the things that users downloaded the app for.
